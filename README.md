## Learning Outcomes
The aim of this tutorial is to build on the basic audio processing in Python from lab sheet 1 and to continue to familiarise yourself with the libraries and concepts introduced in the lectures.

This practical tutorial covers the following learning outcomes within the COMP47700 Speech and Audio module:
* Analyse speech and audio signals and features **[LO1]**
  * Develop the ability to handle audio data in Python, including importing, manipulating, and managing various audio formats

* Create programmes to conduct experiments on speech and audio samples building on third-party software libraries **[LO6]**
  * Attain proficiency in generating sound in Python, exploring techniques and tools to create custom audio signals for diverse applications.
  * Master the visualization of audio data in different domains, including time (Waveform), frequency (Spectrum), and time-frequency (Spectrogram/STFT), utilizing Python tools like librosa, scipy, and numpy for effective frequency domain visualization.


## Module Topics
* Basic audio processing (Unit 2, Unit 3)

## Why Is It Important?
Mastering fundamental audio processing techniques is essential for seamlessly grasping advanced concepts covered later in this module. Whenever you manipulate or generate audio, visualization and normalization in both the time and frequency domains become indispensable. Processing audio using libraries like librosa or scipy is imperative. Proficiency in these fundamental concepts in Python is critical for effectively addressing advanced audio topics such as audio quality, degradation, machine learning pipelines, and is essential for success in the module project.

## Structure of this tutorial
This practical tutorial contains different sections:
* **Live coding:** Basic theory, demos and coding examples presented by the lecturer on site (unmarked)
* **Student activity:** Familiarisation and coding exercises to be completed by the students and followed by a short discussion on site (unmarked). These activities introduce key concepts and skills necessary to complete the assignments.
* **Assignment:** Three (3) take home problem/coding questions to be completed by the students and due in two (2) weeks from the day the practical tutorial is given. Assignment questions represent fifteen (15) mark points.
